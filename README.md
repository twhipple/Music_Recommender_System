*Artist by popularity. I don't really care about pop music, but this graphic was a good way to learn more about the data.*


## Repo Contents
This repo contains the following:
* README.md - this is where you are now!
* Recommender_System.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook containing the finalized code for this project.
* LICENSE.md - the required license information.
* Data - test.csv and train.csv files
* CONTRIBUTING.md 
* Images - contains the fun images to this repo.


## Libraries & Prerequisites
These are the libraries that I used in this project.

* import pandas as pd
* import numpy as np
* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* %matplotlib inline
* import seaborn as sns

## Models
Not sure I will even have models.


## Conclusions
In the end I really couldn't do it. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to use some examples that other people came up with for recommender systems but shy of copying the code I couldn't get them to work. Sometimes, even when I copied the code it still didn't give me the right answer. I know I want a Content-based system now.

## Future Work
I think I need to do a few more basic recommender models - like the classic Movie dataset, or random numbers from the Surprise toolkit. I also need to read more about Content-based vs Collaborative models.
